## Summary
Our goal is to create a Minecraft bot that can learn to dodge enemy projectiles, such as skeleton arrows or blaze fireballs. The bot should be able to identify that the Minecraft mob will be able to fire a projectile and properly dodge the incoming projectile.

## Algorithm
We will be using reinforcement learning with Q-Learning.
