# Indiana Jones AI

Source code: https://github.com/denn9s/indiana-jones

Have you ever seen (or just heard of) the infamous Indiana Jones movies where the pathway to the treasures were all filled with traps? The giant boulder rolling through the cave, the spike traps all over the floors, etc. We wanted to base our AI off of those movies!

Our project involves an AI that learns to dodge arrows fired from the walls in order to reach a treasure at the end of the path. The arrows will be randomly fired from the dispensers at the side of the pathways, and we aim to have an AI that can learn to stop and go through the flurry of arrows.
